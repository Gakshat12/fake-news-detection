# Fake News Detection with Deep Learning

## Overview

The proliferation of fake news presents a significant challenge in the digital age, necessitating robust solutions for its detection and mitigation. This repository presents a comprehensive fake news detection project using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consists of two CSV files: `real.csv` and `fake.csv`, containing 21,417 and 23,481 articles respectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- `real.csv`: Contains 21,417 real news articles.
- `fake.csv`: Contains 23,481 fake news articles.

## Models
Explored the efficacy of various deep learning architectures to distinguish between real and fake news articles, including:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Bidirectional LSTM
- ResNet
- COBRA
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

## Performance

The experimental results demonstrate promising performance across the models, with accuracy metrics ranging from 0.76 to 0.97. Notably, the LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, COBRA, and GRU models exhibit particularly high accuracy scores of 0.97 each, showcasing their effectiveness in discriminating between genuine and fabricated news articles.

## Contributions

Through this comparative analysis, the model provide insights into the strengths and limitations of different machine learning approaches for fake news detection. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing robust tools for combating misinformation and safeguarding the integrity of online information ecosystems.
